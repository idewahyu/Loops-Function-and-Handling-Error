# Loops-Function-and-Handling-Error
## For Loop

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

## While Loop
While loops repeat as long as a certain boolean condition is met (true).

## Else After For
The else function after for is a function that takes precedence over search loops - to provide a program exit when the search is not found.

## Else After While
The else clause only executes when your while condition becomes false. If you break out of the loop, or if an exception is raised, it won't be executed.

## Break
Break stops the loop then exits, followed by executing the statement after the loop block. 

## Continue
The continue statement will stop the current iteration.

## Pass
In Python programming, the pass statement is null. Pass statements in Python are not ignored.

## List Comprehension
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

## Handling Error and Exception
Syntax Error: Syntax Error is a state where python code encounters a write error. The Python interpreter can detect this error while the code is executing

Exception: Exception is a condition when the syntax is written correctly, but an error occurs because the syntax cannot be executed, but because of a mathematical error, an error in the name of the function, library, and others.

## Function
In Python, a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task. Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable. 
Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable.

## Return
The return statement is used to exit a function and go back to the place from where it was called.
